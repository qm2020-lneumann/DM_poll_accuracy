Data, code, graphs and tables for term paper

Please download the data and code. Make sure to store it in one folder. 

Create 3 subfolders: "raw_data", "merged_data" and "tables_figures_and_graphs"

Place 2016_pollster-stats-full_coded.xlsx, 2020_pollster-stats-full_coded.xlsx, covid_state_ts.rds, president_general_polls_2016.csv, president_polls_2020.csv and timestamp_results_nyt_call.xlsx in the "raw_data"-folder if you want to run the full code and see how we merged the data

Place final_2016.RData and final_2020.RData in the "merged_data"-folder (you can skip the merging in the "Code"-file with this and start in line 454)

Place the remaining graphs and tables in the "tables_figures_and_graphs"-folder or run the code to get them.

Make sure that you installed the packages specified to ensure that the code runs smoothly. 
Thank you!
